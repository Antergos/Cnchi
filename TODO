CNCHI TODO LIST (17 May 2013)

* General:
 - Check all file paths (os.path.join)
 - Check if we can remove subprocess calls to pythonian code

* Installer_advanced screen:
 - If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.

* Timezone screen:
 - Add NTP switch

* Keyboard screen:
 - Doesn't sort words that have accents (arcnexus fixed it, needs testing)

* Slide screen:
 - Not all the installer events (messages) are shown. pac.py generates
   too many messages

Alongside branch:
* Autodetect already installed OSes (see bootinfo.py)
* Add a new install option: install alongside other OSes.

FUTURE:
* Remove Easy install option?
* EFI support
* LVM
* Be able to encrypt home directory
